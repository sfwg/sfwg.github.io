            What kind of software developer do you want to be?  If your answer is ‘employed’, we are not looking for you.  If you are actively working to be an exceptional Rails developer or an exceptional frontend developer then you should join SF Working Group.  If you are already spending your days working hard to improve your professional skills, both technical and interpersonal, please come work with us.  You will learn more and grow faster doing it together with a great group of dedicated developers than you will on your own.  The San Francisco Working Group focuses on Pair Programming, TDD, and other Agile Methodologies with reinforcement through code review.  We work to teach each other through lightning talks and brown-bag lunches.

          <h3 class="text-justifed">
            Will you get paid?  Maybe.  We will work with paying customers and as such we can pay people but we do need to know your code can be of professional quality.  The more people we have producing professional quality code, the more paying customers we can take on.
          </h3>
          <h3 class="text-justifed">
            Do we expect you to know everything?  No.  We expect that you will show up, work hard, make progress, and ask questions when you don’t know the answer.  It is better to ask a question when you do not know that to guess and build bad code.  This is easier when working with a pair on a small team.  When you are working with many others, the answer is often in the room.
